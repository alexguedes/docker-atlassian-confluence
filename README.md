A containerized installation of Atlassian Confluence setup with a goal of keeping the installation as default as possible, but with a few Docker related twists.

Want to help out, check out the contribution section.

## Important changes

The Confluence home and installation directory has been moved to `/var/atlassian/confluence` and `/opt/atlassian/confluence/` respectively.

The installation directory `/opt/atlassian/confluence` is not mounted as a volume as standard anymore. Should you need to persist changes in this directory run the container with the additional argument `--volume /opt/atlassian/confluence`.

## Patches

Here you can read about significant changes to the repository/Docker image.

### 25. september 2015

Now bundles the MySQL Connector/J driver which is the official JDBC driver for MySQL. This means that you can now use MySQL as a database backend since it was not bundled by default with the Atlassian Confluence distribution. It looks like Oracle 11g and Microsoft SQL Server drivers are bundled as well as drivers for HyperSQL and PostgreSQL.

## I'm in the fast lane! Get me started

To quickly get started with running a Confluence instance, first run the following command:
```bash
docker run --detach --publish 8090:8090 cptactionhank/atlassian-confluence:latest
```

Then use your browser to nagivate to `http://[dockerhost]:8090` and finish the configuration.

## Contributions

This has been made with the best intentions and current knowledge and thus it shouldn't be expected to be flawless. However you can support this repository with best-practices and other additions. Cirlce-CI has been setup to build the Dockerfile and run acceptance tests on the Atlassian Confluence image to ensure it is working.

Circle-CI has been setup to automatically deploy new version branches when successfully building a new version of Atlassian Confluence in the `master` branch and serves as the base. Futhermore an `eap` branch has been setup to automatically build and commit updates to ensure the `eap` branch contains the latest version of Atlassian Confluence Early Access Preview.

Out of date documentation, lack of tests, etc. you can help out by either creating an issue and open a discussion or sending a pull request with modifications to the appropiate branch.

Acceptance tests are performed by Circle-CI with Ruby using the RSpec, Capybara, and phantomjs frameworks.
